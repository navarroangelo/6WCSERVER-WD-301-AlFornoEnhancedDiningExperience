I.	INTRODUCTION

i.	System Background
In the digital era, the importance of having a dedicated online presence for businesses, particularly restaurants, has never been more critical. Restaurants face fierce competition, and relying solely on social media platforms may not provide the level of engagement, functionality, or professionalism required to attract and retain customers. Al Forno by The Veranda, an Italian restaurant located in Angeles City, Pampanga, currently depends primarily on social media for customer interactions and promotions. While this can be effective for building awareness, it lacks the capability to offer essential features like reservations, menu browsing, and personalized customer engagement. Research has demonstrated that businesses with dedicated websites can offer more tailored customer experiences, leading to higher satisfaction and improved business outcomes (Fosher & Martin, 2017).
Websites allow restaurants to consolidate information and services into a single, easily navigable platform. According to a study by Aluri, Price, and McIntyre (2019), restaurant websites enhance customer experience by providing users with direct access to menus, reservations, and contact details, without the clutter or distractions of social media. Customers are more likely to feel connected to a restaurant when they can browse a thoughtfully curated menu or make reservations directly, without being redirected to external platforms. In contrast, relying on social media for these services can lead to fragmented user experiences, which often result in missed opportunities for engagement.
Al Forno, known for its authentic Italian cuisine and unique indoor and veranda dining experiences, has a brand identity that could greatly benefit from a dedicated website. The research by Zhang and Law (2020) highlights how well-designed restaurant websites help in reinforcing brand identity and building customer loyalty. For Al Forno, a website can reflect its dining ambiance, quality food offerings, and provide a more immersive experience that social media platforms are unable to replicate. Websites offer the ability to customize design elements to reflect the restaurant’s aesthetics, from the typography to the imagery, which enhances the overall customer perception of the brand.
The website will also serve as a powerful tool for operational efficiency. Studies by Ryu and Han (2015) indicate that restaurants with digital reservation systems experience higher booking efficiency and customer satisfaction. For Al Forno, implementing a reservation feature directly on the website would minimize booking errors and allow customers to choose their dining preferences, such as indoor or veranda seating. This streamlining of operations not only improves the user experience but also reduces manual tasks for restaurant staff, allowing them to focus on providing exceptional service.
Furthermore, the importance of mobile-responsive design cannot be understated in today’s smartphone-driven world. A study by Chaffey (2018) found that more than 60% of web traffic now comes from mobile devices, and customers are more likely to abandon websites that are not optimized for mobile browsing. For Al Forno, ensuring that its website is mobile-friendly will allow customers to easily navigate the site, view the menu, and make reservations from their smartphones. This is particularly important as many users may be on the go or making spontaneous dining decisions based on location and availability.
User experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design are crucial factors in determining how successful a restaurant’s website will be. According to Norman (2019), a well-designed UX/UI can significantly impact user behavior, making them more likely to complete a reservation or explore the full range of services a restaurant offers. By employing modern design principles, the Al Forno website can offer a seamless, intuitive browsing experience that mirrors the comfort and elegance of dining at the restaurant itself. Through clear navigation, aesthetically pleasing layouts, and interactive features, the website will become an extension of the restaurant’s brand.
In addition to enhancing customer experience, the website can also improve Al Forno's digital marketing efforts. A study by Clarke (2017) on search engine optimization (SEO) highlights how restaurant websites with optimized content have higher visibility on search engines like Google. With an exclusive website, Al Forno can focus on SEO strategies that target specific keywords, such as "Italian dining in Angeles City" or "best Italian restaurant in Pampanga," which will help draw more organic traffic. Unlike social media, which is reliant on platform algorithms, a website gives the restaurant full control over its online visibility and marketing reach.
Finally, having a dedicated website will allow Al Forno to diversify its customer engagement beyond just likes, shares, or comments on social media. According to research by Kaplan and Haenlein (2016), businesses that integrate multiple channels of customer communication, such as contact forms, direct email, and reservation systems, have a more comprehensive understanding of their customers’ preferences and needs. For Al Forno, this means the ability to gather valuable data about customer behavior, preferences, and feedback, allowing the restaurant to refine its services and offerings continuously.



ii.	Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to create a dedicated MEVN web application for Al Forno by The Veranda, which will address the restaurant’s current reliance on social media for customer interactions and service offerings. Social media, while effective for marketing and building brand awareness, lacks the specialized functionalities necessary for restaurants to provide a seamless customer experience. By developing a dynamic and interactive website, the project aims to offer a platform that will centralize essential services such as reservations, menu browsing, and contact forms, making it easier for customers to engage with the restaurant. This shift will enable Al Forno to differentiate itself from competitors and provide a superior dining experience both online and in person.
One of the key objectives is to implement a real-time reservation system that will streamline the booking process for both customers and staff. Currently, customers must contact Al Forno via social media or phone to make reservations, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially during peak hours. By integrating a reservation feature into the website, users will be able to select their preferred date, time, and dining area (indoor or veranda) directly from the site. This will be linked to a backend system that reflects table availability in real-time, reducing the risk of double bookings and making the process more efficient. This system will also automate confirmation emails or messages, ensuring that customers receive immediate updates on their reservation status.
Another significant objective is to provide a fully detailed, visually appealing, and easily navigable digital menu. Al Forno prides itself on offering authentic Italian cuisine, but presenting this information through social media posts can be limiting and cumbersome for users. A dedicated menu page on the website will allow customers to browse the restaurant’s offerings in a structured and user-friendly format. The menu will feature high-resolution images of the dishes, detailed descriptions, and pricing, giving customers a clear understanding of what to expect. Furthermore, the menu can be updated regularly to reflect seasonal items or special promotions, ensuring that it remains current and accurate without the need for constant social media updates.
The website will also serve as a hub for promoting special events, catering services, and exclusive deals that Al Forno offers. This aligns with the objective of enhancing customer engagement through more direct and effective communication channels. Social media platforms are often flooded with unrelated content, making it difficult for customers to stay informed about specific offerings. A dedicated "Promotions" or "Events" section on the website will allow Al Forno to highlight ongoing deals, upcoming events like wine tastings, or special Italian-themed nights. Customers will have easy access to this information, and the restaurant will benefit from having a more targeted approach to reaching its audience.
In addition to improving customer-facing services, the website will enhance operational efficiency for the restaurant’s management. For instance, the reservation and contact forms will automatically capture customer information, which can be stored in a secure database for future use. This data can be used to analyze customer preferences, such as popular booking times or frequently ordered menu items. The ability to gather and analyze customer data is crucial for making informed decisions about staffing, inventory management, and marketing strategies. This objective aligns with research conducted by Smith and Markland (2016), which emphasizes the role of data-driven decision-making in improving business outcomes for restaurants.
A critical objective of the project is to ensure the website is mobile-responsive, given the increasing number of users accessing the internet via smartphones. Studies by Pew Research Center (2019) show that over 80% of consumers use their mobile devices to research dining options, check menus, and make reservations. Ensuring that Al Forno’s website is optimized for mobile will not only enhance user experience but also increase the likelihood of converting mobile visitors into actual customers. The website’s design will adjust seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring that whether a customer is accessing the site from a smartphone, tablet, or desktop, they will have a consistent and user-friendly experience.
An often overlooked but equally important objective is to improve Al Forno’s visibility through search engine optimization (SEO). By developing a website with proper SEO practices, the restaurant can rank higher in search engine results, making it easier for potential customers to find them. SEO strategies such as incorporating relevant keywords, optimizing meta tags, and regularly updating content will be implemented to ensure the website achieves better search engine performance. This is particularly important for attracting new customers who may be searching for dining options in Angeles City or Italian restaurants in the area. According to Clarke and Edmondson (2018), businesses with optimized websites are more likely to appear in local search results, which can significantly increase foot traffic to the restaurant.
Finally, the website will enhance communication between Al Forno and its customers by providing a direct and efficient contact form. Social media messaging can often be slow and unreliable, as messages may get lost or delayed due to platform algorithms. The website’s contact form will allow customers to submit inquiries about private events, catering, or general questions directly to the restaurant’s management team. This will not only ensure faster response times but also create a more professional and organized communication channel. The objective is to provide customers with a reliable way to reach the restaurant, which can lead to better customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty.
